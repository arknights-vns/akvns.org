## What is this project?

Well, this is the public source code for the website [akvns.org](https://akvns.org).

## What is inside?

- The website: duh!
- And many more features will be added gradually.

and... everything is AGPLv3-licensed, so some of you guys will be pissed a lot, but it is what it is, welcome to OSS.

> Please note that **not everything** will be pushed in here, as in:
>
> - Some of our Arknights-VNS-events-specific patches.
> - A boatload of internal patches.
> - Server config files.
